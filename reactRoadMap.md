# Imp points :-

```
1. React is a "Library"..
2. React is often used to build Single Page Applications (SPAs)
       - With libraries like "React Router", you can switch "pages" without reloading
3. At the end React compile into HTML,CSS,JS, bcz browser did'nt know any frontend- backend liberary or framework..
```

## Why we learn React ?

```
-> Make easy to manage & build complex frontend..
-> build UI,job,hype,trend..
```

## Why React was created. ( search chatGpt for more information )

```
-> To solve "Phantom/ghost message bug" (big problem) ...
-> synccing problem between browser DOM and state/variables in JS

->  Managing Complex UIs
-> Performance Issues
    a. Updating the real DOM repeatedly was slow (No consistency in UI).
    b. React introduced a Virtual DOM, a lightweight copy of the real DOM. It minimizes updates by calculating the difference (diffing) and only applying necessary changes, boosting performance.
-> Virtual DOM – Helps update only necessary parts of the page.
-> Fast User Experience – Since there are no full reloads.
-> Reusabe components

# Topic to Learn (Main topics of react)

```
-> core/fundamentals of React [state or UI manipulation, JSX(HTML in javaScript)]
-> component reusability
-> reusing components by passing props/properties/arguments
-> How to propagate changes (hooks)
```

# Additional topic in React ( addon topics)

```
-> Router (react don't have router)
    - "React-router-dom" addional liberary for routing
-> State management (react dont have the state management)
    - redux,redux toolkit, zustand, contex API..
-> class based componen
    - legacy code (not good)
-> BAAS (Backend As A Service) apps
    - appwrite,firebase,superwrite BAAS products
    - allow directly use backend without write backend
    - helping to build "social media app,e-comerce"
```
